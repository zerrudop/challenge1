The other day, I heard about some snowflakes tryna take my guns and violate my God-given American rights.

I am sick of the woke mob oppressing me. This is worse than when Disney ruined my favorite mermaid princess movie.

In response to all these blue haired betas, I decided to write a poem about how they can try as they might, but they'll never take my guns.

<h2>Come and take it.</h2> <h3>A poem by Dale Wanger</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
Come and take it. Yeah
Try to take it with your soft hands
Nice try, snowflake. That is all you are
Yet it is I who melts at your touch
So woke
But it is I who is up at night
{% endhighlight %}

Up yours woke moralists! We'll see who cancels who!
