<h2>I miss my wife.</h2> <h3>A poem by Dale Wanger</h3>
{% highlight ruby %}
Oh Jane.
Why did you leave me???
This is a new low
Why did you leave me???
I am now the widow
Who is that on your newest Facebook post???
Craig from your office???
Is he why you leave me???
Jane Jane Jane
Pain gain rain refrain abstain
Jane Jane Jane
Stain in main lane in my brain
Jane Jane Jane?
Bane of my exsistence
Jane? of? my? EXSISTANE?
