I"#<p>The other day, I heard about some snowflakes tryna take my guns and violate my God-given American rights.</p>

<p>I am sick of the woke mob oppressing me. This is worse than when Disney ruined my favorite mermaid princess movie.</p>

<p>In response to all these blue haired betas, I decided to write a poem about how they can try as they might, but they’ll never take my guns.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
