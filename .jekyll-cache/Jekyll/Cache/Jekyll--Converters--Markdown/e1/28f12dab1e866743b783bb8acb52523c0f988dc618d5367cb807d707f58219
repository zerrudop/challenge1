I"<p>The other day, I heard about some snowflakes tryna take my guns and violate my God-given American rights.</p>

<p>I am sick of the woke mob oppressing me. This is worse than when Disney ruined my favorite mermaid princess movie.</p>

<p>In response to all these blue haired betas, I decided to write a poem about how they can try as they might, but they’ll never take my guns.</p>

<h2>Come and take it.</h2>
<h3>A poem by Dale Wanger</h3>
